# Skript3D

One of my most larger and painstaking to create scripts

Basically this library allowed you to draw 3d and 2d objects onto Minecraft maps easily

This version is not very well made (does not include face filling, everything must be a wireframe, does not create objects out of shapes, only points, rotations and translations are all local)

Bug fixes and better 3D implementation will be added in the second version
