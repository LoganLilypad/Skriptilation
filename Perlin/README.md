# Perlin

This one is Perlin Noise that I've added to Skript, mainly was going to use it for some terrain generation. Yes I know Perlin Noise is outdated but the algorithm seemed easier to implement into Skript first before I attempt to add Simplex Noise. The noise generates fine except a periodic gap results in the noise to repeat (I have yet to find out why and how to fix it)
