# Mode7

Basically, this script emulates the Mode 7 feature of the Super NES (SNES) and specifically, the game Super Mario Kart

The only thing I added was basic movement and graphical emulation for the course

The race track (map) is created out of blocks, I did create it previously out of a list variable but the server suffered too greatly

:warning: **THIS SCRIPT WILL CAUSE THE TPS (Ticks Per Second) TO DROP, USE WITH CAUTION** :warning:
