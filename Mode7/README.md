# Mode7

Basically, this script emulates the Mode 7 feature of the Super NES (SNES) and specifically, the game Super Mario Kart

The only thing I added was basic movement and graphical emulation for the course

Oh, and I added semi-multiplayer-functionality; the game views are seperate but, if you know what you are doing, you can make it so you can see the other players move around

The race track (map) is created out of blocks, I did create it previously out of a list variable but the server suffered too greatly

:warning: **THIS SCRIPT WILL CAUSE THE TPS (Ticks Per Second) TO DROP, USE WITH CAUTION** :warning:
